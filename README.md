# Ship and Fish Version 2

This Unity project is a simple yet engaging game where a player controls a ship to collect various types of animated fish, including regular, burning, and exploding fish. Each fish type offers a unique interaction and point value when collected. The game showcases Unity's physics engine, prefab instantiation, and basic AI for targeting the nearest objects.

- **Dynamic Fish Spawning**: Fish of different types spawn at random locations on the screen.
- **Ship Control**: The player can control a ship to collect fish, earning points for each fish collected.
- **Animated Fish Types**: Includes several fish types with unique behaviors, such as burning and exploding animations.
